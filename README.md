## OAuth2 Code
### Remote service
This **[remote service](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles-worker-v2)** simulates a browser login session on the official website to authenticate your account.

<ins>**Your credentials are neither stored nor shared**</ins>

The service is provided by Render.com on a free tier, with performance limitations.

> If you want to support the project and extend these limits, <ins>become a hero</ins> and join our **monthly [supporters club](#support-the-project)**!

### Manual
<details><summary><b>Using browser console</b></summary>

As described on config flow, please get the right code from the mobile app redirect like this example (Chrome browser):

</details>
<details><summary><b>Using python tool</b></summary>

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome Python tool to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [stellantis-oauth-helper](https://github.com/benbox69/stellantis-oauth-helper)

</details>
<details><summary><b>Using external service</b></summary>

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome external service to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [OAuth Code Extractor](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/discussions/378)

## Commands
To use remote commands, the "E-remote" or "Connect Plus" service must be activated and configured in the vehicle.

### WakeUp
For some vehicles no updates are received a few minutes after the engine is turned off. Use automations like these to schedule the vehicle wake up:

```yaml
- id: "standby_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle standby WakeUp (every 1 hour)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      hours: /1
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "off"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

```yaml
- id: "charging_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle charging WakeUp (every 5 minutes)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: /5
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "on"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```
\* the entity names above are in english, please use your language entity names.

<ins>**Some users report that performing too many wakeups drains the service battery, making some features unavailable (such as keyless entry)**</ins>.

### Air conditioning Start/Stop
As described in the Stellantis apps, the command is enabled when:
1. The vehicle engine is off;
2. The vehicle doors are locked;
3. The battery level is at least ~~50% (20% for hybrids)~~ 20% or in charging ([#226](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/226));

## Battery capacity / residual sensors
Thanks to the community ([#272](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/272)), it seems that for some vehicles **Stellantis provides incorrect values**. The **switch.battery_values_correction** entity (in your language) applies a correction if active.

\*currently only to the battery_residual sensor

## Errors
<ins>Before any issue request, please check the integration log and look for solution below</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:MAXNBTOOLS
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of associated devices / SMS received. Restore your Stellantis account and try again:
[Follow this procedure from Peugeot community](https://peugeot.my-customerportal.com/peugeot/s/article/AP-I-have-problems-with-the-pin-safety-code-or-I-want-to-change-it-What-can-I-do?language=en_GB).

<ins>**This operation removes the devices connected to your vehicle, no vehicle data will be lost**</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:NOK_BLOCKED
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of wrong PIN used. Re-authenticate the integration.

### Get oauth code error
As described in the "OAuth2 Code > [Remote service](#remote-service)" section, this free service has usage limitations.  
If you've hit these limits, please wait and try again.  
If the problem persists or is unrelated to usage limits, please use "OAuth2 Code > [Manual](#manual)" mode.

## ABRP - A Better Routeplanner
Get a token from [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/):
1. Login to your account;
2. Navigate to vehicle settings;
3. Navigate to real time data;
4. Navigate to edit connections;
5. Generate a token using "Generic" method;

Use the generated token in **abrp_token sensor** and enable **abrp_sync switch** to send updates.
